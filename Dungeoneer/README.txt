       Dungeoneer
  A D&D Text Adventure
  Written in BOTH C++
  And MS Small Basic
------------------------
INFORMATION

There are two versions of Dungeoneer, one written in C++ and the other in SmallBasic.  The C++ source code is available as "dungeoneer.cpp", SmallBasic source code is available as "dungeoneer_sb.sb".  The C++ version executable is "dungeoneer.exe", SmallBasic version executable is "dungeoneer_sb.exe".

Please note that the C++ and SmallBasic versions are BY NO MEANS THE SAME!  The C++ version includes several optimizations over the SmallBasic version in the use of classes and dynamic memory usage, as well as completely different functionality!

Please note that at this point in time the C++ version is only semi-playable due to being incomplete.

Please note that this game is WORK IN PROGRESS.

Please note that this folder is a Mercurial repository committed in TortoiseHG(an upload to GitHub is a possibility, but the GitHub version will not be updated as regularly as the TortoiseHG version).

Please note that "utils.h" is a C++ header file written by me and is covered under the license(it is also necessary to compile a modified version of Dungeoneer if need be).
